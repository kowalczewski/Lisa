- add light-trapping factor (without interference effects in thin film, probably requires to modify the model)
- add more matplotlib plot examples (contour)
- implement silver back reflector (see function for EQE)
- add SRH recombination
- add more comprehensive error handling
- add photon recycling and radiative recombination term (probably can be neglected in Si, but needed if we would like to model GaAs solar cells)
- update license
- update the number of energy points
- correct "The elements of style" (mainly spaces for +, *, brackets for long formula etc.)
- no of points for JV curve should be a parameter
- nicer plots? (using ax.)
- give arguments using, e.g., -i
